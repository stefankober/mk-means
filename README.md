The code and notebook in this repo accompany an article currently under review.

A link will be posted upon availability.

Please feel free to check the [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/stefankober/mk-means/blob/main/mk-means.ipynb) directly in github. It does not seem completely stable though, clicking on "reload" always brought it up in the end.

Graph tools can be found in an additional notebook here: [jupyter notebook mk-means graph analysis](https://github.com/stefankober/mk-means/blob/main/mk-means-graph-analysis.ipynb).
